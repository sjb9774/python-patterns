# python-patterns

This repo is a collection of small, proof-of-concept software design patterns I've 
written for my own educational purposes. Inside the `patterns` folder there are a number
of sub-folders each containing an `__init__.py` file, a file containing a simple 
implementation of the pattern, along with a small suite of tests to confirm it works as
expected.
