# python-patterns

This repo is a collection of small, proof-of-concept software design patterns I've 
written for my own educational purposes. There are a number
of folders, each containing an `__init__.py` file, a file containing a simple 
implementation of the pattern, a markdown file describing the nature of the pattern,
along with a small suite of tests to confirm the implementation works as expected.
